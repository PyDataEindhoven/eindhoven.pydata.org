One of PyData's goals is to increase awareness and excitement around opportunities for underrepresented groups in software engineering and data analytics. To increase diversity in scientific computing, our outreach program ranges from hosting workshops that introduce programming to young women to encouraging diversity in speakers at PyData.

For PyData Eindhoven 2020, we are offering scholarship opportunities to those from underrepresented groups who may otherwise be unable to attend the conference.

Please note scholarships do not cover travel and lodging costs. The deadline to apply is September 7th. Applicants who have been awarded a diversity scholarship will be informed by September 14th.
