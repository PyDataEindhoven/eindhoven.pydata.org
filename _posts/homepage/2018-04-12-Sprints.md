For the first time in its history, PyData Amsterdam will host Open Source Contribution Sprints. These will take place
on Monday the 15th. We will bring together eager developers and maintainers of some of the libraries we all use and 
love to learn and do our share in contributing to open source development. 

Our sprints are a day of intensive development on an open source project of your choice.
It’s a time to come together, to share what you’ve learned during the conference with the people you met, 
and apply it to an open source project. 

# Who can participate?
You! All experience levels are welcome; sprints are a great opportunity to get connected with, 
and start contributing to your favorite Python project. Participation in the sprints is free! We do ask you to
sign up so we can make sure we have enough facilities in place to host everyone. You can express interest in the sprints
when purchasing tickets.
